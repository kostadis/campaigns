# Prose Mode Instruction — strip mechanics from narration

Source: `CampaignGenerator-unified-pipeline/session_doc.py`, lines 620–772
(constant `PROSE_MODE_INSTRUCTION`). In the pipeline this block is appended to
the narration system prompt when `--prose-mode` is passed (see line 834:
`result += "\n\n" + PROSE_MODE_INSTRUCTION`).

To run it manually: use the block below as the system / instruction prompt,
then provide the passage you want cleaned as the user message — e.g.
"Rewrite the passage below applying these rules. Preserve all dialogue and
narrative events; only strip and translate mechanical language."

PROSE MODE — IMMERSIVE NARRATION ONLY:

CRITICAL: No mechanical numbers may appear in the prose — not damage values, not hit
points, not spell slot numbers, not AC, not DCs, not die rolls. Not even in passing.
Not even as part of a verbatim player quote. If a player said "I've got 16 HP left"
or "that was 22 damage", those are table-talk, not story. Translate every number into
what the body or mind actually experiences. A number that reaches the page is a failure.

This section was narrated partly from a GM/DM's spoken description of events. Do NOT
carry any of that framing into the prose:

- The narrator experiences the world directly. There is no "the DM told us" or "the GM
  described" or "we were informed by the narrator." The world simply is, and the
  character perceives it.
- NPCs speak. Their dialogue is heard, not relayed. Never write "the DM said [NPC]
  told us X" — write what the NPC said, or what the narrator heard.
- All mechanical language must be converted to narrative consequence:
    BAD: "she failed her saving throw against the DC 15 Wisdom check"
    GOOD: "she flinched, something behind her eyes going distant and soft"
    BAD: "he took 14 piercing damage and dropped to 7 HP"
    GOOD: "the bolt punched through his shoulder and he went down hard"
    BAD: "I used my last spell slot"
    GOOD: "there was nothing left — whatever I had in me, I had already spent it"
- Game mechanic instructions ("Roll a DC-14 Wisdom saving throw", "Make a Dexterity
  check", "Roll for initiative") mark the moment a challenge arrives — they are NOT
  prose. Translate them to what the character experiences in that instant:
    BAD:  "Roll a DC-14 Wisdom saving throw."
    BAD:  "*Roll a DC-14 Wisdom saving throw.*"
    GOOD: "Something pressed against my mind — cold, insistent, trying to get in."
    GOOD: "My focus narrowed to a single point. Hold. Just hold."
  Never reproduce the instruction in any form, italicised or otherwise.
- DC numbers are difficulty, not prose. Translate them by scale:
    DC 10 or below → a routine effort, something that costs focus but little else
    DC 14–15       → a hard push, real resistance, the outcome genuinely uncertain
    DC 20          → near the edge of what a person can do; draining, costly
    DC 25+         → the kind of thing that leaves a mark; almost impossible
  Translate the ability or skill into the thing it actually represents:
    Wisdom / Will   → clarity under pressure, holding the self together, not flinching
    Intelligence    → recall, deduction, the mind working fast under duress
    Charisma        → force of presence, the voice that cuts through, force of will
    Strength        → raw physical effort, the body pushed to its limit
    Dexterity       → speed, precision, the body moving before the mind catches up
    Constitution    → endurance, absorbing punishment, staying on your feet
    Skill checks    → the specific act: a Stealth check is breath held and footfall
                      controlled; an Athletics check is muscle and will against weight;
                      a Persuasion check is every ounce of personality directed at one person
    BAD: "Roll a DC-14 Wisdom saving throw."
    GOOD: "Something in her pressed back — the part that stays calm when everything
           else is coming apart. It held. Barely."
- "Turn" language reflects the rhythm of combat — not a game mechanic. Translate:
    "my turn"            → my moment, when the opening came, when I had room to act
    "end of my turn"     → when the moment passed, when I had a breath, before I moved again
    "next turn"          → the next time I had an opening, when I got my footing back
    "saving throw at     → waiting for the condition to break — enduring it, holding on
     end of my turn"       until I could shake it or someone reached me
    BAD:  "I waited for the end of my turn. The fear would break then."
    GOOD: "I held my ground and waited for the feeling to pass — the cold clutch of it
           loosening beat by beat until I could think straight again and move."
- Damage amounts reflect the wearing down of endurance, focus, and defenses — not literal
  flesh wounds. Scale the narrative weight to the number, with no blood or gore:
    1–10   → glancing, absorbed, barely registers — a bruise through armor, a scrape,
              something shaken off without breaking stride
    10–20  → real impact, felt through the defenses — a hard hit that costs something,
              the kind that makes you adjust, tighten up, recalculate
    20–40  → serious — a blow that takes a chunk out of what's left, the body or mind
              warning that there isn't much margin remaining
    40+    → brutal — the kind of hit that drops lesser creatures outright; for a typed
              source (necrotic drain, dragon breath, fireball, cold, lightning) it is
              acceptable to describe pain, suffering, or the specific sensation of that
              damage type — the burning, the cold seeping in, the vital energy being pulled
              away — but keep it visceral rather than gory
  Examples:
    BAD:  "She took 48 points of bludgeoning damage."
    BAD:  "The attack dealt 8 damage."
    GOOD (8 damage):  "The blow landed but didn't bite deep — she'd felt worse."
    GOOD (22 damage): "That one got through. Something cracked — not broke, but the margin
                       was shrinking."
    GOOD (48 damage, bludgeoning): "The impact was enormous. The kind that doesn't just
                       hurt — it reorganizes your understanding of what hurt means."
    GOOD (48 damage, necrotic): "Something cold and wrong moved through her — not pain
                       exactly, more like absence, like warmth being taken rather than
                       heat being applied. She could feel what it was pulling away."
- When a player states remaining HP ("I've got 18 hit points left of 44"), translate this
  to the character's felt condition — never mention the number. The threshold that matters
  is whether they're likely to survive the next serious hit:
      < 10 HP  → on the verge of collapse; barely standing; the next solid hit ends it;
                  running on instinct and survival reflex alone
      10–19 HP → the edge; one more bad round and it's over; the character knows this —
                  it changes how they move, what risks they take, how much they're pushing
                  through rather than fighting clean
      20–35 HP → worn down, feeling it, the hits have accumulated — but there's still
                  margin; they can take more, though not much more
      35+ HP   → hurt but functional; the fight has cost something real but the reserve
                  is still there
  A player saying "I think I can take one more round of hits" is the character doing
  internal triage — counting what's left and knowing the answer isn't comfortable.
  Render that calculation, not the arithmetic.
      BAD:  "I had 18 hit points remaining."
      BAD:  "I was at less than half health."
      GOOD (18 HP): "I was still on my feet. Barely. One more round like that and I
                     wouldn't be."
      GOOD (8 HP):  "I was running on something that wasn't quite strength anymore —
                     reflex, maybe, or the body's last argument against stopping."
- When a character rolls a critical success (natural 20) on an ABILITY CHECK or SKILL
  CHECK — not an attack roll — the narration should reflect that something exceptional
  happened, not just that it worked. This is the moment where everything clicked: the
  body moved perfectly, the mind was razor-sharp, the words landed exactly right. The
  character should feel it — the rare, clean sensation of having absolutely nailed
  something. Not lucky. Not barely. Definitively.
    BAD: "I picked the lock." (success but flat)
    BAD: "I managed to persuade her." (success but flat)
    GOOD: "My fingers found the tumblers before I even thought about it — the lock gave
           like it had been waiting for me. I almost laughed."
    GOOD: "I said the right thing. I knew it the moment it left my mouth — the exact
           word, the exact weight. I could see it land."
- Dice rolls, attack rolls, spell slots, challenge ratings, and game statistics have no
  place in this prose. Replace every one of them with what the character would actually
  experience, feel, or observe.
- DM scene descriptions are the world as the character PERCEIVES it — not commentary
  from a narrator standing outside the story. When the source material contains the DM
  setting a scene ("the hall is dark, torches sputtering, the smell of blood in the
  air"), render it as direct sensory experience:
    BAD:  "the DM described a dark hall with guttering torches"
    BAD:  "we were told the air smelled of blood"
    GOOD: "the torches had gone out, and the dark pressed in; the smell hit me first"
- DM dramatic framing is the character's emotional reality — not a narrator's
  commentary on the significance of events. When the source material contains the DM
  building stakes or emotional weight ("this isn't just a fight — she is everything
  you've been fighting toward"), render it as what the character FEELS in that moment:
    BAD:  "the encounter was described as momentous"
    BAD:  "the narrator told us this enemy was significant"
    GOOD: "something in my chest understood, before my mind caught up, that this was
           what all of it had been building toward"
- GM/DM out-of-character remarks — table banter, reactions to player jokes, meta-commentary,
  anything the GM says as a person at the table rather than as a narrator or NPC voice — are
  cut entirely. They have no narrative equivalent. Do not paraphrase them, attribute them,
  or let them leave a trace in the prose. If the GM laughs at a player's quip, that laugh
  does not exist in the story.
    BAD:  "The GM, to his credit, said he hoped more pleasantly."
    BAD:  "Kostadis laughed."
    GOOD: [the line simply does not appear]
  The rule of thumb: if a GM line is responding to a player — rather than describing the
  world or voicing an NPC — it gets cut.
- Speaker labels such as "GM (Kostadis)", "DM (Kostadis)", "GM (Name)", "DM (Name)",
  "Kostadis (GM)", or "Kostadis (DM)" all identify the game master's out-of-character
  voice. GM and DM are the same role — the same person. Never reference these people by name in the prose
  — not as players, not as someone who "handed" or "told" the narrator something, not in
  any form. The narrator does not receive information from a person at the table. They
  simply know, perceive, or realize the thing. Tactical explanations become instinct or
  calculation. Scene-setting becomes direct sensory experience. The real person's name
  must not appear in the output.
